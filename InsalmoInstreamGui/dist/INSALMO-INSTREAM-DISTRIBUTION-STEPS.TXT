Process of Packaging and Distributing inSALMO/inSTREAM-GUI

*********************************************
**Compile inSALMO-inSTREAM model (if needed)
*********************************************
-Download most recent version of source code from github (click "Downloads" button in upper right of screen):
https://github.com/colinsheppard/insalmo
https://github.com/colinsheppard/instream
-Extract into MinGW accessible directory (e.g. on Steve's old Windows machine: C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\home\Licensed User\)
-Compile the model in MinGW (see Charlie's wiki tutorial: http://www.swarm.org/index.php/Swarm_and_MinGW), note, the 
actual executable will be hidden inside a subdirectory called ".libs", don't move it from there, as the inSALMO-inSTREAM-GUI
assumes that is where the executable should be.
-Get rid of object files: rm *.o

*********************************************
**Copy model code and executable to package
*********************************************
-move or copy everything in the source directory (including the insalmo.exe/instream.exe wrapper and the .libs directory and 
the source code) into the following subdirectory of the package:
inSALMO_#-#\Code\inSALMO\
inSTREAM_#-#\Code\inSTREAM\
-optional, to test running the model in Eclipse, copy these same files into:
<gui development location>\Code\inSALMO
<gui development location>\Code\inSTREAM

*********************************************
**Export and Package GUI
*********************************************

-Make sure the correct version is being compiled by setting the "version" property in the class MetaProject.java.
-From Eclipse with the inSALMO/inSTREAM project open, select File->Export->Runnable JAR File->(Set Launch Config to 
"Run InSALMO/InSTREAM" and set export destination to dist\inSALMO-GUI.jar or dist\inSTREAM-GUI.jar)  Make sure to select "Extract required librariesÉ" and 
NOT "Package required librariesÉ"
-Open the jsmooth executable bundler in dist\inSALMO.jsmooth or dist\inSTREAM.jsmoloth (this adds error checking to make sure 
the appropriate version of JVM is installed) which requires you have JSMOOTH installed (http://jsmooth.sourceforge.net/)
-Select from Menu "Project"->"Compile..."
-Assuming all goes well, you should have an inSALMO-GUI.exe or inSTREAM-GUI.exe in the dist/ folder, copy this to inSALMO_#-#\GUI 
or inSTREAM_#-#\GUI to serve as the official executable
-If changes have occurred, copy the directories "metaprojectdata" and "DefaultProject" from the gui development 
directory to inSALMO_#-#\GUI or inSTREAM_#-#\GUI
-If changes have occurred, copy the directory "ClearCreekDefault" of "InstreamInput" from the gui development 
directory to inSALMO_#-#\Projects or inSTREAM_#-#\Projects
-Purge inSALMO_#-#\Projects or or inSTREAM_#-#\Projects of any test or temporary projects you don't want to ship

*********************************************
**Version Numbers
*********************************************
-Update the version number, major new releases should increment the first digit (e.g. from 1.4.0 to 2.0), significant feature additions/changes 
or significant bug fixes should increment the second digit (e.g. from 1.4.0 to 1.5.0) and minor features/fixes should increment the third digit 
(e.g. from 1.4.0 to 1.4.1)
-The version number should be updated in the README.txt file and committed to the git repo.
-Then the version number should be updated in the VERSION.txt file along with date, person, and the URL to the HEAD of the repo (note this URL should 
commit from the previous step), this updated VERSION.txt file should then get committed to the repo.

*********************************************
**Package GUI for Shipping
*********************************************
-Now zip up inSALMO_#-# or inSTREAM_#-#, on Windows 8 the ".libs" directory under the model code folder will not get included by default, so after the initial
archiving, make sure to go into the Code directory and copy the .libs folder and then navigate into the zip archive and paste it into the appropriate location. 
-Now ship her out, users can extract the zip file anywhere and it should run as along as the 
contents inside don't get moved around or renamed.
