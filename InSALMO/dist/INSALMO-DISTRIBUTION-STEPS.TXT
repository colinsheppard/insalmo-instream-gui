Process of Packaging and Distributing inSALMO-GUI

*********************************************
**Compile inSALMO model (if needed)
*********************************************
-Download most recent version of source code from github (click "Downloads" button in upper right of screen):
https://github.com/colinsheppard/insalmo
-Extract into MinGW accessible directory (e.g. on Steve's old Windows machine: C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\home\Licensed User\)
-Compile the model in MinGW (see Charlie's wiki tutorial: http://www.swarm.org/index.php/Swarm_and_MinGW), note, the 
actual executable will be hidden inside a subdirectory called ".libs", don't move it from there, as the inSALMO-GUI
assumes that is where the executable should be.
-Get rid of object files: rm *.o

*********************************************
**Copy model code and executable to package
*********************************************
-move or copy everything in the source directory (including the insalmo.exe wrapper and the .libs directory and 
the source code) into the following subdirectory of the package:
inSAMLO_#-#\Code\inSALMO\
-optional, to test running the model in Eclipse, copy these same files into <gui development location>\Code\inSALMO

*********************************************
**Export and Package GUI
*********************************************
-From Eclipse with the inSAMLO project open, select File->Export->Runnable JAR File->(Set Launch Config to 
"Run InSALMO" and set export destination to dist\inSALMO-GUI.jar)
-Open the jsmooth executable bundler in dist\inSALMO.jsmooth (this adds error checking to make sure the appropriate 
version of JVM is installed) which requires you have JSMOOTH installed (http://jsmooth.sourceforge.net/)
-Select from Menu "Project"->"Compile..."
-Assuming all goes well, you should have an inSALMO-GUI.exe in the dist/ folder, copy this to inSALMO_#-#\GUI to 
serve as the official executable
-If changes have occurred, copy the directories "metaprojectdata" and "DefaultProject" from the gui development 
directory to inSALMO_#-#\GUI
-If changes have occurred, copy the directory "ClearCreekDefault" from the gui development 
directory to inSALMO_#-#\Projects
-If changes have occurred, copy the .bat file from dist\run-inSALMO.bat to inSALMO_#-#\dist\
-Purge inSALMO_#-#\Projects of any test or temporary projects you don't want to ship

-Now zip up inSALMO_#-# and ship her out, users can extract the zip file anywhere and it should run as along as the 
contents inside don't get moved around or renamed.
